# eve-shields

This is a small web service that allows the creation of [EVE online](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eve_Online) related dynamic to be used on web sites or github pages. Like the ones below that show stats for this github repo.

## Features

Create shields based on current zKillboard statistics for an EVE entity, e.g. member count for an alliance

## Example

Shield with the current member count of Test Alliance Please Ignore:

![Member Count](https://img.shields.io/endpoint?url=https://eve-shields.kalkoken.net/zkb-stats/alliance/498125261/member-count)

Link to create this shield:

```plain
https://img.shields.io/endpoint?url=https://eve-shields.kalkoken.net/zkb-stats/alliance/498125261/member-count
```

## How it works

The shield are created by a service called [shields.io](shields.io), which is providing many different shields for people to use. They also provide an API for dynamically creating shields with custom input from an endpoint.

**eve-shields** functions as such an endpoint and provides all data in the required format to shields.io for creating Eve Online related shields. Data is dynamically loaded from APIs like zKillboard API as needed.

## How to use it

I am hosting this service on a server and you are free to use it directly for your website or github pages (at your own risk though - I can not guaranteer any kind of service level).

Or you can install and run it on your own web server. There are many ways, but I recommend using PyInstaller, which is the easiest. You will need a web server (e.g. NGINX) and a WSGI server (e.g Gunicorn) to run it.

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/ErikKalkoken/eve-shields
```

Note that if you run it yourself you need to have SSL, because shields.io only accepts https links as endpoint.

## Syntax

To create your own shield use the JSON endpoint URL from shield.io and add the endpoint URL from eve-shields for the `url` parameter

The syntax for [shields.io JSON endpoint](https://shields.io/endpoint) is:

```plain
https://img.shields.io/endpoint?url={url-eve-shields}&style=...
```


The basic syntax for the  eve shields endpoint url is:

```plain
https://eve-shields.kalkoken.net/{category}/...
```

 `category` defines the category of shields to create. Currently only `zkb-stats` is supported.

Note that you still can add query parameters from shields.io to customize your shield, e.g. if you want to override the color (`color`) or label (`label`) generated by eve-shield.

### category: zkb-stats

`zkb-stats` provides zKillboard statistics for EVE entities.  See [here](https://github.com/zKillboard/zKillboard/wiki/API-(Statistics)) for details on the API. Please note though that only a sub set is currently implemented.

#### syntax

The syntax for the 

```plain
https://eve-shields.kalkoken.net/zkb-stats/{entity-type}/{entity-id}/{shield-name}
```

- `entity-type`: name of the EVE entity type. The following types are supported:
  - alliance
  - character
  - corporation  
  - faction
  - region
  - shipGroup
  - shipType  
  - solarSystem
- `entity-id`: a valid EVE ID corresponding to the entity type, e.g. `498125261` for Test Alliance Please Ignore.
- `shield-name`: name of the shield to create.

### shields

Name | Description | Example

dangerRatio | Danger classification by zKillboard | ![Dummy](https://img.shields.io/badge/Dummy-tbd-yellow)
iskDestroyed | Total ISK destroyed | ![Dummy](https://img.shields.io/badge/Dummy-tbd-yellow)
iskLost | Total ISK lost | ![Dummy](https://img.shields.io/badge/Dummy-tbd-yellow)
memberCount | Total ISK lost | ![Dummy](https://img.shields.io/badge/Dummy-tbd-yellow)
shipsDestroyed | Total ships destroyed | ![Dummy](https://img.shields.io/badge/Dummy-tbd-yellow)
shipsLost | Total ships lost | ![Dummy](https://img.shields.io/badge/Dummy-tbd-yellow)

All examples with Test Alliance Please Ignore.

Note that not all shields are available for every entity type, e.g. there is no member count for ships.
